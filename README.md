_Sorting Visualizer_

A Visual Exploration of Sorting Algorithms
This repository provides a Java-based visualization tool to help you understand the inner workings of various sorting algorithms. By animating the sorting process, you can gain insights into their efficiency and complexity.
Implemented Algorithms:
 * Bubble Sort
 * Insertion Sort
 * Shell Sort
 * Selection Sort
 * Merge Sort
 * (Add more as you implement them)
How to Use:
 * Clone the Repository:
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/SortingVisualizer.git

 * Compile and Run:
   Ensure you have a Java Development Kit (JDK) installed. Compile and run the main class of your project. This will launch the visualization application.
 * Interact with the Visualization:
   * Start/Pause: Control the animation speed or pause it altogether.
   * Algorithm Selection: Choose the sorting algorithm to visualize.
   * Array Size: Adjust the number of elements in the array.
   * Array Generation: Generate random or sorted arrays.
Color Coding:
 * Blue: Element is currently being processed.
 * Green: Elements are being compared.
 * Yellow: Element is being read.
 * Pink: Default color for elements.
Future Enhancements:
 * Additional Algorithms: Implement more sorting algorithms like Quick Sort, Heap Sort, etc.
 * Performance Analysis: Add features to compare the time and space complexity of different algorithms.
 * User Interface: Improve the user interface for better interaction and customization.
Enjoy Visualizing Sorting!
